## Common Commands 

```sh
flutter pub run build_runner build
```

## Get Credential Files

./get-credentials.sh
```

## Screenshots 

To setup, follow the instructions in [screenshots | Dart Package](https://pub.dev/packages/screenshots) 

The configuration file is `screenshots.yaml`

You will need appropriately named emulators and the emulators may (shouldn't but may) need to be open.

From the project dir, run: 

```sh
screeenshots
```

## Redux RemoteDevTools (RDT)

- find the IP address of the computer 
- use one of the strings in `utilities/mock.dart` or make a new one 
- edit `main.dart` to use the correct IP 
- run the remotedev server

```
remotedev --port 8000
```

- open a web page with url:

```
http://localhost:8000
```

## Code gen with built_value 

After making changes to built_value classes run the builder to generate the new code:

```sh
flutter pub run build_runner build
```

## App Icons 

We use [flutter_launcher_icons](https://github.com/fluttercommunity/flutter_launcher_icons). To change the app icons, replace `assets/images/app-icon-large-white.png` and run: 

```sh
flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons:main
```

## Tests 

### Unit and Widget Tests
