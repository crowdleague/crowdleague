## This document is very much a WIP 

### PRs 

#### Treat PRs as the start of a process, not the end 

- When you finish a PR you have setup the next stage, which is a collaborative process. 

#### Reviewing a PR is a collaboration, not gatekeeping 

- When reviewing a PR, if you have a suggestion, try creating a new branch off the PR branch and putting up a PR with your changes. 
- Try to create a collaborative spirit. 

ALWAYS close loops 

- when something lands in your space (eg. someone asks a question or suggests an action) try to identify any open loops and close them: 
  - acknowledge receipt ASAP 
  - create a task/issue to track (and link back to the original interaction if possible) 

TRY to remove all mental references for GC 
- same idea as "ALWAYS close loops" but different analogy 
- acknowledge receipt so the person can release the reference they are holding about the communication 
- create issues/tasks so there is a single external reference rather than several mental references 

ALWAYS reply straight away 
- the loss of focus is probably worth it 
- if you don't want to lose focus, turn off notifications 

TRY to be a Clean Team Member 
- clean as in clean code but relating to working in a team 
- things that land in your space get taken care of so others can avoid needing to keep track 
- communicate clearly and constructively any mental 'stuff' that is taking up head space 
- help other team members by quickly and effectively responding to their mental stuff so we clean it up together 

PREFER using Asana over email 

#### Standups
- goal is to get the team up to speed on where you are in your workflow. And identify anything blocking you.
- with the goal of preventing discussions that could waste someones time
  - try to push any discussions to post-standup 
  - all team members please feel free to transform into stand up police should a discussion that is wasting your time erupt
    - stand up police have all rights to flag conversations as post-standup items
